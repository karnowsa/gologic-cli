// deployCmd represents the deploy command
var deployCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "deploy",
	Short: "Manage Weblogic Deployments",
	Long: `The deploy subcommand gives the oppurtunity to manage the Weblogic Deyployments.
With the app command you can pass a path to a deployment and which target should be deployed. The second command is the "list" command, which simply prints the current deployment list.

	For example:
	gologictl deploy app /usr/src/hello.war -t cluster1
	gologictl deploy list
	`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		cmd.Help()
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(deployCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// deployCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// deployCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
